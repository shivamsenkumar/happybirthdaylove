     It seems like yesterday when I was trying to find a study buddy on discord server and got a random text from you to study together. We talked that night for the first time where I tried to wow you with my fake intellectual prowess and as we kept talking, I realised OMG!! THIS IS MY PERSON. Our relationship has come a veryy long way since then. I never ever thought I'll have a bond sooo strong with someone, the growth of our relationship was really exponential. People talk for years and still don't have proper chemistry but with you I felt an instant connection. You'd understand me even when I wasn't able to express myself properly. You're my safe space, I can speak anything in front of you without having the fear of being judged. We have sooo many things in common that it really makes me say we are same soul in different bodies. Uk how at the starting of any relationship, things are exciting and it deteriorates but with you that phase seems to be unending, you're like a really interesting Novel which never ends, no matter how much you read it just leaves you wanting for more plus I swear I feel more close to you with every passing day (Even with the fights).

     Our bond is extremely special, unique in its own way and truly irreplaceable. You are always there for me when my spirits need a lift. It's fascinating how unaware we were of each other's existence and now you're the most important person in may life. I seriously don't know how I would handled sooo many things in my life without you. Everything around me can change but I know that you'll be my constant. My forever!!

     I know I am not as good as you at expressing myself using words but I hope this website gave you a little idea that how much you mean to me. You are truly a gem and finding you has really made me believe in Karma (I must have done something really good). You're the most kindest and adorable person I've come across. We've always managed to stay together even with all ups and downs and I hope that we never give up on each other. You have my unconditional love, no matter what happens I'll always be your bestfriend and just one text away.  I loveee youuu....
